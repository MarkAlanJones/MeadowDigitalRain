# MeadowDigitalRain
Matrix like animation for Meadow using Graphics Library

It is known as "DigitalRain".
I ported it to C# from https://github.com/0015/TP_Arduino_DigitalRain_Anim which was featured on HackADay https://hackaday.com/2021/11/17/arduino-library-makes-digital-rain-like-its-1999/

It is a bit slow, and may not be as accurate to the film as some would like
